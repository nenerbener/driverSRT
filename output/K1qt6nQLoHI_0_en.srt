1
00:00:02,170 --> 00:00:07,275
FUTURES".

2
00:00:07,275 --> 00:00:08,843
>>> AFTER AN INCREDIBLY BUSY

3
00:00:08,845 --> 00:00:09,945
WEEK IN OUR NATION'S CAPITAL AND

4
00:00:09,945 --> 00:00:12,747
FOR THE COUNTRY, I SAT DOWN FOR

5
00:00:12,749 --> 00:00:13,749
AN INTERVIEW WITH PRESIDENT

6
00:00:14,750 --> 00:00:16,350
EVERYTHING FROM HIS UP COMING

7
00:00:16,352 --> 00:00:18,185
SUPREME COURT PICK TO THE DEBATE

8
00:00:18,187 --> 00:00:19,588
OVER TARIFFS AND PHASE TWO OF

9
00:00:23,992 --> 00:00:24,759
>> MR. PRESIDENT, THANK YOU VERY

10
00:00:24,760 --> 00:00:25,893
MUCH FOR SITTING DOWN WITH ME.

11
00:00:25,894 --> 00:00:26,495
>> THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

12
00:00:26,495 --> 00:00:27,328
>> I WANT TO START WITH THE

13
00:00:27,329 --> 00:00:28,829
BREAKING NEWS OF THE WEEK, AND

14
00:00:28,830 --> 00:00:31,533
THAT IS JUSTICE ANTHONY KENNEDY

15
00:00:31,533 --> 00:00:32,199
ANNOUNCING HIS RETIREMENT.

16
00:00:32,201 --> 00:00:34,668
IS JUSTICE KENNEDY THE MODEL OF

17
00:00:34,670 --> 00:00:36,304
THE PERSON YOU WOULD PUT ON THE

18
00:00:36,304 --> 00:00:36,838
SUPREME COURT NOW?

19
00:00:36,838 --> 00:00:37,838
>> MAYBE SO.

20
00:00:41,377 --> 00:00:43,978
YOU KNOW, I GOT A CALL, MARIA,

21
00:00:47,750 --> 00:00:48,450
ACTING ANONYMOUS.

22
00:00:48,451 --> 00:00:49,484
I SAID WAIT A MINUTE.

23
00:00:49,484 --> 00:00:50,851
I'M THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED

24
00:00:50,853 --> 00:00:51,419
STATES.

25
00:00:51,420 --> 00:00:52,754
HOW CAN I SEE SOMEBODY?

26
00:00:55,357 --> 00:00:56,791
WAS A VERY ELEGANT MOMENT.

27
00:00:56,792 --> 00:00:57,859
IT WAS A BEAUTIFUL MOMENT.

28
00:00:57,859 --> 00:01:00,228
HE PRESENTED ME WITH A LETTER,

29
00:01:08,570 --> 00:01:10,204
A VERY -- HE ENDED UP BEING A

30
00:01:10,206 --> 00:01:11,640
LITTLE MORE NEUTRAL THAN A LOT

31
00:01:11,641 --> 00:01:12,808
OF PEOPLE WOULD HAVE PREFERRED,

32
00:01:12,808 --> 00:01:14,843
BUT A LOT OF PEOPLE PREFERRED

33
00:01:14,843 --> 00:01:15,242
THAT HE WAS.

34
00:01:15,243 --> 00:01:16,710
AND WE'RE GOING TO PICK SOMEBODY

35
00:01:16,712 --> 00:01:17,412
WHO IS OUTSTANDING.

36
00:01:17,412 --> 00:01:19,313
I SAID I WILL DO IT IN YOUR

37
00:01:19,314 --> 00:01:20,447
HONOR, BUT WE'RE GOING TO PICK

38
00:01:20,448 --> 00:01:21,917
SOMEBODY WHO IS OUTSTANDING.

39
00:01:21,918 --> 00:01:26,221
I WAS VERY HONORED THAT HE DID

40
00:01:26,221 --> 00:01:27,354
THIS DURING MY TERM.

41
00:01:27,355 --> 00:01:28,489
WHICH MEANS HE HAD CONFIDENCE IN

42
00:01:28,490 --> 00:01:30,358
ME TO DO THE RIGHT THING.

43
00:01:36,132 --> 00:01:36,998
MIGHT VOTE ON ROE VERSUS WADE?

44
00:01:36,998 --> 00:01:38,866
>> WELL, THAT'S A BIG ONE.

45
00:01:38,867 --> 00:01:39,533
AND PROBABLY NOT.

46
00:01:39,534 --> 00:01:40,835
THEY ARE ALL SAYING DON'T DO

47
00:01:40,837 --> 00:01:41,302
THAT.

48
00:01:41,304 --> 00:01:41,903
YOU DON'T DO THAT.

49
00:01:41,903 --> 00:01:42,670
YOU SHOULDN'T DO THAT.

50
00:01:42,671 --> 00:01:44,905
BUT I'M PUTTING CONSERVATIVE

51
00:01:44,906 --> 00:01:45,340
PEOPLE ON.

52
00:01:45,340 --> 00:01:48,475
AND I'M VERY PROUD OF NEIL

53
00:01:50,780 --> 00:01:53,781
HIS OPINIONS ARE, YOU KNOW, SO

54
00:01:53,783 --> 00:01:55,683
WELL WRITTEN, SO BRILLIANT.

55
00:01:55,685 --> 00:01:58,887
AND I'M GOING TO TRY AND DO

56
00:01:58,888 --> 00:01:59,788
SOMETHING LIKE THAT, BUT I DON'T

57
00:01:59,789 --> 00:02:01,689
THINK I'M GOING TO BE SO

58
00:02:01,691 --> 00:02:03,758
SPECIFIC IN THE QUESTIONS I WILL

59
00:02:03,759 --> 00:02:04,225
BE ASKING.

60
00:02:04,227 --> 00:02:05,560
I'M ACTUALLY TOLD THAT I

61
00:02:07,495 --> 00:02:08,329
YOU SAID YOU WOULD LEAVE IT TO

62
00:02:10,366 --> 00:02:11,166
BE TO THE STATES.

63
00:02:11,167 --> 00:02:12,300
YOU NEVER KNOW HOW THAT'S GOING

64
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:13,133
TO TURN OUT.

65
00:02:13,134 --> 00:02:15,836
THAT'S A VERY COMPLEX QUESTION.

66
00:02:15,837 --> 00:02:18,205
THE ROE V. WADE IS PROBABLY THE

67
00:02:18,206 --> 00:02:20,407
ONE THAT PEOPLE ARE TALKING

68
00:02:20,408 --> 00:02:22,676
ABOUT IN TERMS OF HAVING AN

69
00:02:24,580 --> 00:02:25,947
BUT IT COULD VERY WELL END UP

70
00:02:25,948 --> 00:02:27,581
WITH STATES AT SOME POINT.

71
00:02:27,582 --> 00:02:28,449
>> AND DO YOU THINK YOU WILL BE

72
00:02:28,450 --> 00:02:30,150
ABLE TO GET YOUR NOMINEE IN

73
00:02:30,151 --> 00:02:31,352
PLACE BEFORE THE MIDTERM

74
00:02:31,354 --> 00:02:31,720
ELECTIONS?

75
00:02:31,721 --> 00:02:32,687
>> I THINK IT IS GOING TO VERY

76
00:02:32,687 --> 00:02:33,187
QUICKLY.

77
00:02:33,188 --> 00:02:34,388
I THINK WE'RE GOING TO HAVE A

78
00:02:36,558 --> 00:02:37,925
FROM DEMOCRATS, FRANKLY.

79
00:02:37,926 --> 00:02:39,293
I THINK -- IF IT'S THE RIGHT

80
00:02:39,294 --> 00:02:39,627
PERSON.

81
00:02:39,628 --> 00:02:40,661
I'M GOING TO PICK THE RIGHT

82
00:02:43,466 --> 00:02:43,998
THAT'S OUTSTANDING.

83
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:47,668
OUTSTANDING, BUT I'M GOING TO

84
00:02:47,669 --> 00:02:48,637
PICK SOMEBODY WHO IS

85
00:02:48,638 --> 00:02:49,938
OUTSTANDING.

86
00:02:49,938 --> 00:02:51,438
YES, I THINK WE WILL GO VERY

87
00:02:51,439 --> 00:02:51,772
QUICKLY.

88
00:02:51,774 --> 00:02:53,741
A LOT OF PEOPLE THINK IT WILL BE

89
00:02:53,742 --> 00:02:55,509
A VERY -- IT IS PROBABLY GOING

90
00:02:55,510 --> 00:02:56,411
TO BE VICIOUS BECAUSE THE OTHER

91
00:02:56,412 --> 00:02:57,746
SIDE ALL THEY CAN DO IS OBSTRUCT

92
00:02:57,747 --> 00:02:58,413
AND RESIST.

93
00:02:58,413 --> 00:03:01,582
YOU KNOW, THE WHOLE THING IS

94
00:03:01,584 --> 00:03:01,917
RESIST.

95
00:03:01,918 --> 00:03:02,884
BUT -- AND MAYBE SOME DAY WE

96
00:03:04,620 --> 00:03:05,287
I DON'T KNOW.

97
00:03:05,288 --> 00:03:06,487
BUT RIGHT NOW IT IS ONLY RESIST.

98
00:03:06,489 --> 00:03:07,889
THAT'S ALL THEY WANT TO DO IS

99
00:03:07,889 --> 00:03:10,157
STOP THINGS FROM HAPPENING.

100
00:03:10,158 --> 00:03:12,526
SO THEY ARE GOING TO TRY VERY

101
00:03:12,527 --> 00:03:14,728
HARD BUT I THINK IT WILL GO

102
00:03:14,729 --> 00:03:15,729
QUICKLY IF I PICK THE RIGHT

103
00:03:17,300 --> 00:03:19,401
INTO LAW A HISTORIC TAX REFORM

104
00:03:19,401 --> 00:03:19,733
PACKAGE.

105
00:03:19,735 --> 00:03:21,503
FIRST TIME IN 30 YEARS.

106
00:03:21,503 --> 00:03:23,471
HAS THE EFFECT BEEN WHAT YOU

107
00:03:23,472 --> 00:03:23,838
EXPECTED?

108
00:03:23,838 --> 00:03:25,105
>> WELL, I THINK THERE'S A

109
00:03:25,106 --> 00:03:25,840
DOUBLE EFFECT.

110
00:03:25,841 --> 00:03:28,944
THE TAX CUTS HAVE BEEN

111
00:03:31,546 --> 00:03:32,379
TAX CUTS HAVE BEEN INCREDIBLE.

112
00:03:32,381 --> 00:03:33,882
>> THE ROLLBACK IN REGULATIONS,

113
00:03:33,883 --> 00:03:34,182
HUGE.

114
00:03:34,182 --> 00:03:35,483
>> I ACTUALLY THINK MAYBE AT

115
00:03:35,484 --> 00:03:36,784
LEAST INITIALLY SPEAKING BECAUSE

116
00:03:36,786 --> 00:03:39,454
IT'S BEEN EARLIER TOOK PLACE

117
00:03:39,455 --> 00:03:41,256
QUICKER, THE REGULATION ROLLBACK

118
00:03:41,257 --> 00:03:42,324
HAS BEEN THE BIGGEST EVER IN THE

119
00:03:42,324 --> 00:03:44,858
HISTORY OF OUR COUNTRY.

120
00:03:44,860 --> 00:03:46,561
NO PRESIDENT EVEN DURING FULL

121
00:03:46,562 --> 00:03:47,862
TERMS HAS CUT BACK ANYWHERE NEAR

122
00:03:47,862 --> 00:03:48,395
WHAT I HAVE DONE.

123
00:03:48,396 --> 00:03:49,396
AND WE HAVE MORE TO DO.

124
00:03:49,397 --> 00:03:50,799
NOW, WE'RE GOING TO HAVE

125
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:51,199
REGULATION.

126
00:03:51,199 --> 00:03:52,333
WE'RE GOING TO HAVE CLEAN WATER.

127
00:03:52,335 --> 00:03:53,134
WE'RE GOING TO HAVE, YOU KNOW,

128
00:03:53,134 --> 00:03:53,701
CLEAN AIR.

129
00:03:53,703 --> 00:03:55,437
WE'RE GOING TO HAVE THE CLEANEST

130
00:03:55,437 --> 00:03:57,571
WATER, CLEANEST AIR, BUT WE

131
00:03:57,573 --> 00:03:59,407
ARE -- WE HAVE MORE REGULATION

132
00:03:59,407 --> 00:04:01,842
CUTTING TO DO.

133
00:04:01,843 --> 00:04:03,144
I THINK THAT MIGHT HAVE HAD A

134
00:04:03,145 --> 00:04:04,445
BIGGER IMPACT TO THIS POINT.

135
00:04:04,447 --> 00:04:05,947
I THINK ULTIMATELY THE TAX CUTS

136
00:04:05,948 --> 00:04:06,981
AS THEY KICK IN AND THEY ARE

137
00:04:06,983 --> 00:04:07,983
KICKING IN -- YOU SEE THE KIND

138
00:04:07,984 --> 00:04:09,384
OF HUNDREDS OF BILLIONS OF

139
00:04:09,384 --> 00:04:11,618
DOLLARS BROUGHT BACK INTO THE

140
00:04:11,620 --> 00:04:12,120
COUNTRY ALREADY.

141
00:04:12,121 --> 00:04:13,888
I THINK ULTIMATELY THAT'S GOING

142
00:04:13,889 --> 00:04:14,756
TO BE SOMETHING REALLY SPECIAL.

143
00:04:14,757 --> 00:04:16,290
AND YOU'RE SEEING THE RESULT

144
00:04:16,291 --> 00:04:17,191
RIGHT NOW.

145
00:04:17,192 --> 00:04:21,228
>> I AGREE YOU BECAUSE UNDER

146
00:04:21,230 --> 00:04:22,197
OBAMA THE FEDERAL REGISTRY PAGES

147
00:04:22,197 --> 00:04:23,731
WERE UP TO 90,000 SOMETHING

148
00:04:23,733 --> 00:04:24,932
PAGES OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT.

149
00:04:24,934 --> 00:04:26,568
>> IF DEMOCRATS WOULD HAVE WON

150
00:04:26,569 --> 00:04:27,502
THE ELECTION, YOU WOULD HAVE A

151
00:04:27,502 --> 00:04:28,769
LOT OF DIFFERENT -- IF YOU LOOK

152
00:04:28,771 --> 00:04:29,804
AT THE LAST FOUR DECISIONS ON

153
00:04:29,805 --> 00:04:31,372
THE SUPREME COURT AT 5-4, THEY

154
00:04:31,374 --> 00:04:32,540
WOULD HAVE ALL BEEN REVERSED.

155
00:04:32,540 --> 00:04:34,509
THE UNION DECISION WAS A MASSIVE

156
00:04:34,509 --> 00:04:34,875
DECISION.

157
00:04:34,877 --> 00:04:36,377
THE, YOU KNOW, YOU CAN LOOK AT

158
00:04:36,379 --> 00:04:37,645
ANY ONE OF THOSE FOUR, THEY WERE

159
00:04:37,646 --> 00:04:39,381
ALL SO BIG, SO IMPORTANT.

160
00:04:39,382 --> 00:04:40,848
AND THEY WOULD HAVE BEEN EXACTLY

161
00:04:40,850 --> 00:04:41,216
REVERSED.

162
00:04:41,216 --> 00:04:43,283
SO MANY -- THAT'S WHY I'VE

163
00:04:43,285 --> 00:04:45,487
ALWAYS HEARD THAT AS PRESIDENT,

164
00:04:45,487 --> 00:04:46,788
I MEAN OBVIOUSLY OUTSIDE OF WAR

165
00:04:46,788 --> 00:04:48,288
AND PEACE, THE BIGGEST DECISION

166
00:04:48,290 --> 00:04:49,724
YOU CAN MAKE IS THE SELECTION OF

167
00:04:55,463 --> 00:04:56,630
MEAN, THOSE DECISIONS WOULD HAVE

168
00:04:56,632 --> 00:04:58,233
ALL GONE THE OTHER WAY.

169
00:04:58,233 --> 00:05:01,168
>> AND YOUR LEGACY ON THE

170
00:05:01,170 --> 00:05:01,936
CONSERVATIVE PARTY ON THE G.O.P.

171
00:05:01,937 --> 00:05:04,439
IS GOING TO BE MASSIVE OBVIOUSLY

172
00:05:04,439 --> 00:05:05,606
WITH THIS VERY CONSEQUENTIAL

173
00:05:05,608 --> 00:05:06,574
DECISION MAKING THAT YOU NEED TO

174
00:05:06,574 --> 00:05:06,841
DO.

175
00:05:06,841 --> 00:05:07,207
>> RIGHT.

176
00:05:07,209 --> 00:05:08,543
>> LET ME ASK YOU ABOUT WHAT'S

177
00:05:08,543 --> 00:05:08,842
NEXT.

178
00:05:08,843 --> 00:05:10,677
BECAUSE WE'VE SEEN THE IMPACT TO

179
00:05:10,678 --> 00:05:11,745
THE ECONOMY.

180
00:05:11,747 --> 00:05:13,915
WHAT DO YOU WANT TO SEE HAPPEN

181
00:05:13,915 --> 00:05:14,182
NOW?

182
00:05:14,182 --> 00:05:15,817
DOES THE ECONOMY NEED EVEN MORE

183
00:05:15,817 --> 00:05:16,183
STIMULUS?

184
00:05:16,185 --> 00:05:19,220
ARE YOU LOOKING FOR A PHASE 2 --

185
00:05:19,221 --> 00:05:20,788
>> WE'RE DOING A PHASE 2,

186
00:05:22,925 --> 00:05:24,559
IT WILL BE MORE OF A MIDDLE

187
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:24,858
CLASS.

188
00:05:24,860 --> 00:05:26,995
WE DID A LOT FOR THE MIDDLE

189
00:05:29,464 --> 00:05:30,831
WE'RE THINKING ABOUT BRINGING

190
00:05:30,833 --> 00:05:32,133
THE 21% DOWN TO 20.

191
00:05:32,134 --> 00:05:34,602
FOR THE MOST PART THE REST OF IT

192
00:05:34,603 --> 00:05:35,703
WOULD GO TO THE MIDDLE CLASS.

193
00:05:35,704 --> 00:05:36,638
IT IS A GREAT STIMULUS.

194
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:38,105
AND ONE OF THE THINGS I'M DOING

195
00:05:40,175 --> 00:05:41,909
YOU'RE A BELIEVER, BUT I THINK

196
00:05:41,911 --> 00:05:42,843
YOU ARE GETTING THERE, LOOK

197
00:05:42,845 --> 00:05:44,846
WHAT'S HAPPENING WITH THE STEEL

198
00:05:44,846 --> 00:05:45,212
COMPANIES.

199
00:05:45,213 --> 00:05:46,180
THEY ARE EXPANDING.

200
00:05:47,516 --> 00:05:48,817
WE NEED ALUMINIUM.

201
00:05:48,817 --> 00:05:49,983
AND WE NEED SOLAR PANELS.

202
00:05:49,985 --> 00:05:51,286
YOU KNOW, THE SAME THING WITH

203
00:05:51,286 --> 00:05:53,387
SOLAR PANELS, IT WAS LIKE A DEAD

204
00:05:53,389 --> 00:05:55,523
BUSINESS, AND WE DID A 30%

205
00:05:55,524 --> 00:05:56,624
TARIFF BECAUSE THEY WERE DUMPING

206
00:05:56,625 --> 00:05:58,625
ALL OVER THE PLACE.

207
00:06:02,697 --> 00:06:03,730
IS A BIG BUSINESS.

208
00:06:03,732 --> 00:06:04,899
IF YOU LOOK AT WHAT'S HAPPENED

209
00:06:04,899 --> 00:06:07,468
TO STEEL AND ALUMINIUM, WE

210
00:06:07,470 --> 00:06:08,970
PRACTICALLY BUILT A NEW INDUSTRY

211
00:06:08,971 --> 00:06:10,405
IN A PERIOD OF FOUR OR FIVE

212
00:06:10,406 --> 00:06:10,737
MONTHS.

213
00:06:10,738 --> 00:06:11,839
IT IS INCREDIBLE WHAT'S

214
00:06:11,841 --> 00:06:12,206
HAPPENING.

215
00:06:12,208 --> 00:06:13,842
THE BIG THING I'M FOCUSED NOW IS

216
00:06:13,843 --> 00:06:14,141
TRADE.

217
00:06:14,142 --> 00:06:15,909
I HAVE TO STRAIGHTEN OUT TRADE

218
00:06:15,911 --> 00:06:16,211
DEALS.

219
00:06:19,814 --> 00:06:20,415
A DEAL WITH CHINA.

220
00:06:20,415 --> 00:06:22,182
NOBODY BOTHERED TO MAKE A DEAL.

221
00:06:22,184 --> 00:06:23,885
THEY WILL CHARGE 25% FOR A CAR

222
00:06:23,886 --> 00:06:25,552
AND WE CHARGE 2 1/2% AND YOU

223
00:06:25,553 --> 00:06:26,787
HAVE USED THOSE NUMBERS ON YOUR

224
00:06:30,492 --> 00:06:31,826
BUT WE HAVE A -- WE HAVE THE

225
00:06:31,826 --> 00:06:32,726
WORST TRADE DEALS OF THE WORLD.

226
00:06:32,728 --> 00:06:35,329
WE LOSE MONEY WITH EVERYBODY.

227
00:06:35,331 --> 00:06:38,432
YOU KNOW WHEN SOMEBODY ASKS HOW

228
00:06:38,434 --> 00:06:39,400
MUCH DO WE LOSE WITH THIS

229
00:06:39,401 --> 00:06:39,734
COUNTRY?

230
00:06:39,735 --> 00:06:40,535
WE LOSE WITH EVERYBODY.

231
00:06:40,536 --> 00:06:42,470
WE ARE GOING TO MAKE THEM

232
00:06:42,471 --> 00:06:43,403
RECIPROCAL, FAIR, AND I WILL

233
00:06:43,404 --> 00:06:44,705
TELL YOU THAT YOU DON'T KNOW

234
00:06:44,706 --> 00:06:46,740
ABOUT THIS, BUT EVERY COUNTRY IS

235
00:06:49,612 --> 00:06:50,879
IT IS ALL GOING TO WORK OUT

236
00:06:52,982 --> 00:06:54,415
>> I THINK THEY TRUST ME.

237
00:06:54,415 --> 00:06:55,750
THE FARMER TRUST ME.

238
00:06:55,750 --> 00:06:56,650
>> THEY DO.

239
00:06:56,651 --> 00:06:58,552
>> DON'T FORGET, THE FARMERS,

240
00:06:58,553 --> 00:07:00,220
YOU LOOK AT A MAP, IT IS GOT A

241
00:07:00,221 --> 00:07:01,455
LITTLE BLUE ON THE OUTSIDE,

242
00:07:01,456 --> 00:07:03,824
EVERYTHING ELSE IS RED, AND IT'S

243
00:07:03,826 --> 00:07:05,793
BEAUTIFUL COLOR RED, BUT I HAVE

244
00:07:05,793 --> 00:07:08,295
TO SAY THAT IF YOU LOOK AT

245
00:07:12,901 --> 00:07:14,468
DECLINE, OVER THE LAST -- I HAVE

246
00:07:14,470 --> 00:07:15,603
BEEN HERE A YEAR AND A HALF,

247
00:07:15,603 --> 00:07:16,803
OVER THE LAST FIVE YEARS, THEY

248
00:07:16,805 --> 00:07:17,971
HAVE BEEN VERY BAD YEARS FOR

249
00:07:17,973 --> 00:07:19,641
FARMS AND FARMERS.

250
00:07:19,641 --> 00:07:20,975
I SAID WE HAVE TO CHANGE THAT.

251
00:07:20,975 --> 00:07:22,776
AND ONE OF THE REASONS IS

252
00:07:22,778 --> 00:07:24,112
BECAUSE THEY HAVE BARRIERS.

253
00:07:24,112 --> 00:07:25,213
THESE AREN'T EVEN ECONOMIC

254
00:07:25,213 --> 00:07:25,579
BARRIERS.

255
00:07:25,581 --> 00:07:29,918
ALTHOUGH IN CANADA'S CASE, 275%

256
00:07:29,918 --> 00:07:31,185
TARIFF FOR DAIRY.

257
00:07:31,187 --> 00:07:31,953
THAT'S NOT FAIR.

258
00:07:31,954 --> 00:07:33,588
>> WHEN WOULD YOU EXPECT YOUR

259
00:07:33,588 --> 00:07:34,189
MOST SIGNIFICANT DEAL?

260
00:07:34,189 --> 00:07:35,557
>> WELL, I ALREADY PRETTY MUCH

261
00:07:35,557 --> 00:07:36,990
FINISHED THE DEAL WITH SOUTH

262
00:07:36,992 --> 00:07:37,325
KOREA.

263
00:07:37,326 --> 00:07:38,159
IT WAS A TERRIBLE DEAL.

264
00:07:43,432 --> 00:07:44,232
FOR US.

265
00:07:47,468 --> 00:07:48,635
THAT'S DONE.

266
00:07:48,637 --> 00:07:49,437
NAFTA I COULD START IT TOMORROW,

267
00:07:49,437 --> 00:07:50,737
BUT I'M NOT HAPPY WITH IT.

268
00:07:50,738 --> 00:07:53,840
I WANT TO MAKE IT MORE FAIR.

269
00:07:53,841 --> 00:07:54,141
OKAY.

270
00:07:55,411 --> 00:07:56,810
>> I WANT TO WAIT TILL AFTER THE

271
00:07:56,812 --> 00:07:57,177
ELECTION.

272
00:07:57,178 --> 00:07:57,844
YOU ARE GOING TO HAVE AN

273
00:07:57,846 --> 00:07:58,213
ELECTION.

274
00:07:58,213 --> 00:08:00,747
IT IS GOING TO BE VERY

275
00:08:00,749 --> 00:08:01,149
INTERESTING.

276
00:08:04,752 --> 00:08:06,486
ARE NOT FINE, I WILL TAX THEIR

277
00:08:06,487 --> 00:08:07,521
CARS COMING INTO AMERICA.

278
00:08:07,523 --> 00:08:08,122
THAT'S THE BIG ONE.

279
00:08:08,122 --> 00:08:09,723
THE CARS ARE THE BIG ONE.

280
00:08:09,725 --> 00:08:10,792
WE COULD TALK STEEL, WE COULD

281
00:08:10,793 --> 00:08:11,259
TALK EVERYTHING.

282
00:08:11,259 --> 00:08:11,959
THE BIG THING IS THE CARS.

283
00:08:11,961 --> 00:08:13,394
>> A MAJOR LOBBYING GROUP FOR

284
00:08:17,333 --> 00:08:20,168
TARIFF ON ALL IMPORTED VEHICLES

285
00:08:20,168 --> 00:08:21,835
WILL AMOUNT TO 45 BILLION

286
00:08:21,836 --> 00:08:23,538
DOLLARS IN TAXES ON CONSUMERS

287
00:08:23,538 --> 00:08:26,473
AND WIPE OUT ANY BENEFITS OF THE

288
00:08:26,475 --> 00:08:27,942
TAX CUT PLAN FOR LOW AND MIDDLE

289
00:08:27,942 --> 00:08:28,442
INCOME AMERICANS.

290
00:08:28,444 --> 00:08:30,311
>> WELL, ACTUALLY IT IS 20%,

291
00:08:30,312 --> 00:08:31,679
TELL THEM TO GET THEIR NUMBERS

292
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:31,980
RIGHT.

293
00:08:31,980 --> 00:08:33,914
LOOK, MARIA, WHAT'S GOING TO

294
00:08:33,916 --> 00:08:34,682
REALLY HAPPEN THERE'S GOING TO

295
00:08:34,682 --> 00:08:36,250
BE NO TAX.

296
00:08:36,251 --> 00:08:37,150
YOU KNOW WHY?

297
00:08:37,152 --> 00:08:38,152
THEY ARE GOING TO BUILD THEIR

298
00:08:38,153 --> 00:08:38,820
CARS IN AMERICA.

299
00:08:38,821 --> 00:08:39,854
THEY ARE GOING TO MAKE THEM

300
00:08:39,855 --> 00:08:40,153
HERE.

301
00:08:40,154 --> 00:08:41,488
WE BRING IN MILLIONS AND

302
00:08:41,490 --> 00:08:43,124
MILLIONS OF CARS A YEAR.

303
00:08:43,125 --> 00:08:44,458
WE CHARGE 2 1/2%.

304
00:08:44,460 --> 00:08:45,727
SOME OF THESE COUNTRIES DON'T

305
00:08:45,727 --> 00:08:47,227
EVEN TAKE OUR CARS.

306
00:08:47,229 --> 00:08:48,997
IF WE WANT TO SEND GENERAL

307
00:08:48,998 --> 00:08:50,131
MOTORS OR ANY OF OUR COMPANIES

308
00:08:50,131 --> 00:08:52,699
TO SOME OF THESE COUNTRIES, THEY

309
00:08:52,701 --> 00:08:54,802
HAVE A BARRIER, THEY PUT UP A

310
00:08:54,802 --> 00:08:56,236
BARRIER, NONMONETARY BARRIER.

311
00:08:56,238 --> 00:08:58,539
THEY CALL IT NONMONETARY TARIFF.

312
00:08:58,539 --> 00:09:00,207
AND THE BARRIER IS SO STRONG YOU

313
00:09:00,208 --> 00:09:00,974
CAN'T SELL A CAR.

314
00:09:00,975 --> 00:09:04,645
IF YOU DO SELL A CAR, IT IS 10%,

315
00:09:07,649 --> 00:09:08,716
>> YEAH.

316
00:09:08,716 --> 00:09:10,183
DO YOU AGREE THOUGH THAT A

317
00:09:12,453 --> 00:09:14,521
MY SHOW LAST WEEK HE SAID LOOK,

318
00:09:14,523 --> 00:09:15,990
FOR EVERY JOB YOU'RE CREATING IN

319
00:09:15,990 --> 00:09:17,225
THE ALUMINIUM AND STEEL

320
00:09:21,830 --> 00:09:22,397
ALUMINIUM AND STEEL.

321
00:09:22,398 --> 00:09:23,130
THAT'S A SALES TAX.

322
00:09:23,131 --> 00:09:24,698
>> FIRST OF ALL I LOVE FREE

323
00:09:24,700 --> 00:09:24,999
TRADE.

324
00:09:26,634 --> 00:09:27,735
SAID I HAVE AN IDEA EVERYBODY I

325
00:09:27,735 --> 00:09:29,903
WILL GUARANTEE YOU WE WILL DO IT

326
00:09:29,904 --> 00:09:31,471
IMMEDIATELY NOBODY PAY ANYMORE

327
00:09:34,677 --> 00:09:35,643
EVERYBODY ARE YOU ALL SET?

328
00:09:35,644 --> 00:09:37,245
NO MORE TAX.

329
00:09:37,245 --> 00:09:37,427
CANADA

330
00:09:39,380 --> 00:09:40,914
275% FOR YOUR DAIRY AND YOU ARE

331
00:09:40,916 --> 00:09:41,716
GOING TO TAKE DOWN YOUR BARRIERS

332
00:09:41,716 --> 00:09:43,484
K WE WILL TAKE DOWN THE BARRIERS

333
00:09:43,485 --> 00:09:45,219
AND THE TAXES.

334
00:09:45,220 --> 00:09:46,120
DO YOU KNOW WHAT HAPPENED?

335
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:48,489
EVERYBODY SAID CAN WE GO ON TO

336
00:09:48,490 --> 00:09:48,990
ANOTHER SUBJECT?

337
00:09:48,990 --> 00:09:53,293
BECAUSE AMERICA, OUR COUNTRY

338
00:09:53,294 --> 00:09:54,895
LOST LAST YEAR 817 BILLION

339
00:09:54,897 --> 00:09:56,397
DOLLARS IN TERMS OF DEFICIT.

340
00:09:56,398 --> 00:09:59,533
WE HAD A TRADE DEFICIT, MARIA OF

341
00:09:59,534 --> 00:10:01,935
817 BILLION, WITH A B, DOLLARS

342
00:10:01,937 --> 00:10:02,736
LAST YEAR.

343
00:10:06,107 --> 00:10:06,406
YEARS.

344
00:10:06,408 --> 00:10:07,108
WE HAVE REBUILT CHINA.

345
00:10:07,109 --> 00:10:08,810
I HAVE A GREAT RELATIONSHIP WITH

346
00:10:08,811 --> 00:10:09,944
CHINA.

347
00:10:11,879 --> 00:10:12,679
I HAVE TREMENDOUS RESPECT FOR

348
00:10:12,681 --> 00:10:14,349
HIM, BUT I SAID WE HAVE TO

349
00:10:14,350 --> 00:10:15,249
STRAIGHTEN THIS OUT.

350
00:10:15,250 --> 00:10:16,149
WE CAN'T CONTINUE TO DO THIS.

351
00:10:16,150 --> 00:10:18,452
>> YOU DECIDED TO NOT GO FORWARD

352
00:10:18,453 --> 00:10:23,323
WITH THE INVESTMENT RESTRICTIONS

353
00:10:26,394 --> 00:10:28,663
>> NO, LOOK, 250 BILLION DOLLARS

354
00:10:28,663 --> 00:10:29,996
WORTH OF PRODUCT, THE TARIFFS

355
00:10:29,998 --> 00:10:31,232
ARE -- IN FACT, IT COULD GO UP

356
00:10:31,232 --> 00:10:34,334
TO 500, FRANKLY, IF WE DON'T

357
00:10:36,572 --> 00:10:37,605
I WILL TELL YOU, CHINA WANTS TO

358
00:10:37,605 --> 00:10:38,239
MAKE A DEAL.

359
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:39,907
IT'S GOT TO BE A FAIR DEAL FOR

360
00:10:39,908 --> 00:10:40,341
THIS COUNTRY.

361
00:10:40,341 --> 00:10:42,677
ONE OF THE HARD THINGS IS, OUR

362
00:10:42,677 --> 00:10:43,945
PRESIDENTS AND OUR BUSINESS

363
00:10:43,946 --> 00:10:45,812
LEADERS, THEY WERE MISSING IN

364
00:10:45,813 --> 00:10:46,146
ACTION.

365
00:10:46,148 --> 00:10:46,980
NOT SO MUCH THE BUSINESS

366
00:10:46,981 --> 00:10:47,314
LEADERS.

367
00:10:47,316 --> 00:10:48,750
YOU KNOW, SOME BUSINESS LEADERS

368
00:10:48,750 --> 00:10:50,650
BENEFIT BY ALLOWING THIS STUFF

369
00:10:50,652 --> 00:10:51,853
TO GO ON, THAT'S THE PROBLEM,

370
00:10:51,854 --> 00:10:54,722
THEY BENEFIT.

371
00:10:54,722 --> 00:10:56,790
THEY'RE MORE FOR THEIR BUSINESS

372
00:10:56,792 --> 00:10:58,292
THAN THEY ARE FOR THE UNITED

373
00:10:58,293 --> 00:10:58,625
STATES.

374
00:10:58,626 --> 00:10:59,760
I HAD THE HEAD OF THE GREAT

375
00:10:59,761 --> 00:11:00,894
COMPANY COME UP TO ME, VERY

376
00:11:00,895 --> 00:11:02,195
SERIOUSLY AFFECTED BY THE

377
00:11:02,197 --> 00:11:03,297
TARIFFS, HE SAID MR. PRESIDENT,

378
00:11:03,298 --> 00:11:04,932
IT IS NOT GOOD FOR ME RIGHT NOW.

379
00:11:04,932 --> 00:11:05,799
ULTIMATELY IT IS, BUT YOU ARE

380
00:11:05,801 --> 00:11:06,934
DOING THE RIGHT THING ON

381
00:11:06,934 --> 00:11:07,267
TARIFFS.

382
00:11:07,269 --> 00:11:08,302
>> YOU ARE DOING THE RIGHT THING

383
00:11:08,302 --> 00:11:09,669
ON PUSHING BACK ON CHINA AS

384
00:11:09,671 --> 00:11:09,971
WELL.

385
00:11:09,971 --> 00:11:10,737
MOST PEOPLE UNDERSTAND THAT THEY

386
00:11:10,739 --> 00:11:11,672
HAVE BEEN STEALING FROM US FOR

387
00:11:12,707 --> 00:11:17,511
>> BUT YOU DIDN'T DO FORWARD

388
00:11:17,513 --> 00:11:19,714
WITH THIS BAN ON CHINESE

389
00:11:19,715 --> 00:11:22,884
NATIONALS ACQUIRING 25% STAKE IN

390
00:11:22,884 --> 00:11:24,152
AMERICAN COMPANIES, NOW PEOPLE

391
00:11:24,153 --> 00:11:25,720
WANT TO KNOW HOW ARE YOU GOING

392
00:11:25,721 --> 00:11:27,721
TO PROTECT AMERICAN INNOVATION,

393
00:11:27,722 --> 00:11:28,121
TECHNOLOGY?

394
00:11:28,123 --> 00:11:28,855
>> WE ARE DOING IT THROUGH

395
00:11:28,856 --> 00:11:30,390
DIFFERENT THINGS WHAT I DIDN'T

396
00:11:30,392 --> 00:11:31,959
LIKE IS PINPOINTING CHINA,

397
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:33,127
BECAUSE IT'S NOT FAIR.

398
00:11:33,128 --> 00:11:35,629
I GET SAY LONG WITH CHINA.

399
00:11:35,630 --> 00:11:37,865
I LIKE THE PRESIDENT.

400
00:11:37,865 --> 00:11:38,732
PRESIDENT FOR LIFE, WE CAN CALL

401
00:11:38,734 --> 00:11:39,867
HIM THE KING; RIGHT?

402
00:11:39,868 --> 00:11:41,102
I LIKE THE PRESIDENT.

403
00:11:41,102 --> 00:11:42,469
I DIDN'T LIKE PINPOINTING CHINA.

404
00:11:42,471 --> 00:11:43,370
I DON'T THINK IT'S FAIR.

405
00:11:43,371 --> 00:11:45,772
THEY ARE NOT THE ONLY ONE.

406
00:11:45,774 --> 00:11:47,240
NOW THEY ARE BIGGER AND STRONGER

407
00:11:47,241 --> 00:11:49,376
AND FRANKLY THEY DO IT MORE AND

408
00:11:49,378 --> 00:11:52,413
THEY'RE PROBABLY A BIGGER

409
00:11:52,413 --> 00:11:53,213
VIOLATOR, BUT IT IS OTHER

410
00:11:53,215 --> 00:11:53,781
COUNTRIES TOO.

411
00:11:53,782 --> 00:11:55,283
I WANTED TO GO WORLDWIDE.

412
00:11:55,283 --> 00:11:56,350
AND WE'RE DOING THAT.

413
00:11:56,350 --> 00:11:58,852
SO ACTUALLY WHAT I'M DOING IS A

414
00:11:58,854 --> 00:12:01,322
VERY SIMILAR THING, BUT I WANT

415
00:12:01,322 --> 00:12:02,622
IT TO PERTAIN TO EVERYBODY.

416
00:12:02,624 --> 00:12:04,959
SO YOU MEAN CHINA CAN'T DO IT

417
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:06,461
BUT OTHER COUNTRIES CAN?

418
00:12:06,461 --> 00:12:08,395
I KNOW CHINA AND I KNOW HOW

419
00:12:08,397 --> 00:12:09,163
SMART THEY ARE.

420
00:12:09,163 --> 00:12:10,630
THEY WILL SEND THEIR PEOPLE INTO

421
00:12:12,100 --> 00:12:13,167
THROUGH OTHER COUNTRIES AND GO

422
00:12:13,168 --> 00:12:14,802
THROUGH AN EXTRA PROCESS

423
00:12:14,802 --> 00:12:16,537
>> THAT'S WHY YOU HAD TO DO IT

424
00:12:16,538 --> 00:12:17,871
TO EVERYBODY, EVEN OUR FRIENDS?

425
00:12:17,873 --> 00:12:19,340
>> I WANT EVERYBODY TO DO IT.

426
00:12:19,341 --> 00:12:20,575
SAME THING WITH THE TARIFFS ON

427
00:12:20,576 --> 00:12:22,744
THE STEEL, IF WE DON'T HAVE IT

428
00:12:20,883 --> 00:12:22,050
AMERICAN TECHNOLOGY AND

429
00:12:22,051 --> 00:12:22,450
INNOVATION.

430
00:12:22,451 --> 00:12:23,084
MORE NOW ON MY EXCLUSIVE

431
00:12:23,085 --> 00:12:26,653
INTERVIEW.

432
00:12:26,654 --> 00:12:27,922
MARIA: IF WE'RE TRYING TO STOP

433
00:12:27,923 --> 00:12:28,923
CHINA FROM STEALING FROM US,

434
00:12:28,923 --> 00:12:31,091
WHICH WE KNOW IS HAPPENING.

435
00:12:31,092 --> 00:12:33,060
>> IT IS TRUE.

436
00:12:36,932 --> 00:12:37,599
MARIA: EXACTLY.

437
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:39,000
WOULD IT BE BETTER TO ACTUALLY

438
00:12:39,999 --> 00:12:40,501
HAVE OUR ALLIES TOGETHER TO GO

439
00:12:40,503 --> 00:12:42,470
AGAINST CHINA INSTEAD OF PUSHING

440
00:12:42,471 --> 00:12:46,307
BACK ON OUR ALLIES LIKE EUROPEAN

441
00:12:46,307 --> 00:12:46,640
NATIONS?

442
00:12:53,014 --> 00:12:53,047
>> TH

443
00:12:53,048 --> 00:12:53,447
>> THE

444
00:12:53,448 --> 00:12:53,480
>> THE E

445
00:12:53,481 --> 00:12:53,514
>> THE EUR

446
00:12:53,515 --> 00:12:53,548
>> THE EUROP

447
00:12:53,548 --> 00:12:53,581
>> THE EUROPEA

448
00:12:53,581 --> 00:12:53,615
>> THE EUROPEAN

449
00:12:53,615 --> 00:12:53,648
>> THE EUROPEAN UN

450
00:12:53,649 --> 00:12:53,681
>> THE EUROPEAN UNIO

451
00:12:53,682 --> 00:12:53,715
>> THE EUROPEAN UNION,

452
00:12:53,716 --> 00:12:53,748
>> THE EUROPEAN UNION, T

453
00:12:54,182 --> 00:12:55,682
LOOK AT THE CAR SITUATION, THEY

454
00:12:55,683 --> 00:12:57,351
SEND A MERCEDES IN, WE CAN'T

455
00:12:57,352 --> 00:12:59,486
SEND OUR CARS IN.

456
00:12:59,488 --> 00:13:01,623
LOOK WHAT THEY DO TO OUR

457
00:13:01,624 --> 00:13:01,956
FARMERS.

458
00:13:01,956 --> 00:13:03,057
THEY DON'T WANT OUR FARM

459
00:13:03,057 --> 00:13:03,423
PRODUCTS.

460
00:13:03,424 --> 00:13:04,658
THEY HAVE THEIR FARMERS THEY

461
00:13:04,659 --> 00:13:06,995
WANT TO PROTECT THEIR FARMERS.

462
00:13:06,995 --> 00:13:08,162
WE DON'T PROTECT OURS AND THEY

463
00:13:10,466 --> 00:13:11,733
LOOK AT A TRADE SURPLUS WHICH I

464
00:13:11,734 --> 00:13:16,937
THINK IS A VERY IMPORTANT THING,

465
00:13:22,144 --> 00:13:24,144
MANY YEARS AGO MEANING MY

466
00:13:24,145 --> 00:13:25,379
PARENTS WERE BORN IN THE

467
00:13:25,380 --> 00:13:27,615
EUROPEAN UNION.

468
00:13:27,615 --> 00:13:29,550
I LOVE THOSE COUNTRIES.

469
00:13:29,552 --> 00:13:35,188
GERMANY AND ALL OF THE COUNT

470
00:13:35,190 --> 00:13:35,890
RIS.

471
00:13:35,890 --> 00:13:36,256
SCOTLAND.

472
00:13:36,258 --> 00:13:41,496
-- GERMANY AND ALL OF THE

473
00:13:41,496 --> 00:13:43,897
COUNTRIES, SCOTLAND.

474
00:13:43,899 --> 00:13:47,434
THEY TREAT US VERY BADLY.

475
00:13:47,436 --> 00:13:49,403
EXCUSE ME, I CAN SAY IT IN A

476
00:13:49,404 --> 00:13:50,137
DIFFERENT WAY.

477
00:13:50,139 --> 00:13:51,605
THEY MADE LAST YEAR 151 BILLION

478
00:13:51,606 --> 00:13:52,940
DOLLARS IN TRADE SURPLUS.

479
00:13:52,942 --> 00:13:53,508
MARIA: ON AMERICA.

480
00:13:53,509 --> 00:13:57,879
>> WE HAD A DEFICIT WITH THE EU

481
00:24:39,705 --> 00:24:41,807
COMING MIDTERM ELECTIONS AND HOW

482
00:24:41,807 --> 00:24:43,142
SOME DEMOCRATS IN THEIR CALL TO

483
00:24:43,143 --> 00:24:44,108
ABOLISH I.C.E. COULD ULTIMATELY

484
00:24:48,781 --> 00:24:50,348
YESTERDAY, AND YOU CALLED OUT

485
00:24:50,349 --> 00:24:51,082
HARLEY-DAVIDSON AND YOU HAVE

486
00:24:51,084 --> 00:24:52,151
BEEN CALLING OUT --

487
00:24:52,152 --> 00:24:53,751
>> I DON'T LIKE THAT THEY ARE

488
00:24:53,752 --> 00:24:54,852
LEAVING.

489
00:24:54,854 --> 00:24:56,221
THEY ARE NOT LEAVING --

490
00:24:58,892 --> 00:25:01,927
BECAUSE WE CAN'T DEAL WITH THE

491
00:25:01,928 --> 00:25:04,330
RETALIATORY TARIFFS OUT OF

492
00:25:04,330 --> 00:25:05,964
EUROPE THAT'S BECAUSE OF OUR

493
00:25:05,965 --> 00:25:06,298
TARIFFS.

494
00:25:06,298 --> 00:25:07,633
SHOULD YOU BE CALLING OUT

495
00:25:07,634 --> 00:25:08,334
SPECIFIC COMPANIES?

496
00:25:08,335 --> 00:25:09,367
YOU ARE THE PRESIDENT.

497
00:25:09,368 --> 00:25:09,867
>> YES I SHOULD.

498
00:25:09,868 --> 00:25:12,136
I DEVOTED A LOT OF TIME TO

499
00:25:15,709 --> 00:25:16,709
HARLEY-DAVIDSON VOTED FOR TRUMP.

500
00:25:16,710 --> 00:25:19,144
THEY CALLED BIKERS FOR TRUMP.

501
00:25:22,915 --> 00:25:24,682
NOW, WE JUST PROPOSED THIS A FEW

502
00:25:24,683 --> 00:25:25,517
DAYS AGO.

503
00:25:25,518 --> 00:25:26,652
THEY MADE THIS DEAL AT THE

504
00:25:26,653 --> 00:25:27,685
BEGINNING OF THE YEAR, LONG

505
00:25:27,686 --> 00:25:28,686
BEFORE THEY EVER HEARD OF THE

506
00:25:28,688 --> 00:25:29,321
WORD TARIFF.

507
00:25:29,321 --> 00:25:30,388
THEY MADE THIS DEAL AT THE

508
00:25:32,491 --> 00:25:32,758
IT.

509
00:25:32,759 --> 00:25:34,326
I THINK THAT HARLEY IS AN

510
00:25:34,326 --> 00:25:35,527
AMERICAN BIKE.

511
00:25:35,528 --> 00:25:36,662
IT IS AN AMERICAN MOTORCYCLE.

512
00:25:36,663 --> 00:25:37,730
AND THEY SHOULD BUILD THEM IN

513
00:25:37,730 --> 00:25:38,463
THIS COUNTRY.

514
00:25:38,464 --> 00:25:39,530
THEY SHOULDN'T PLAY CUTE.

515
00:25:42,102 --> 00:25:42,500
MONTHS AGO.

516
00:25:42,501 --> 00:25:43,034
MARIA: I REMEMBER.

517
00:25:43,036 --> 00:25:45,437
>> THEY WERE TELLING ME IN INDIA

518
00:25:45,438 --> 00:25:46,905
THEY CHARGE 100%.

519
00:25:46,905 --> 00:25:48,941
MARIA: YOU SAID THAT.

520
00:25:48,942 --> 00:25:51,509
>> I THINK I TAUGHT THEM MORE

521
00:25:51,510 --> 00:25:54,278
ABOUT TARIFFS THAN I COULD EVER

522
00:25:54,279 --> 00:25:54,879
LEARN.

523
00:26:01,654 --> 00:26:01,953
100%.

524
00:26:01,954 --> 00:26:03,154
I GOT THEM TO REDUCE THE TARIFFS

525
00:26:03,155 --> 00:26:04,789
IN INDIA BECAUSE THEY USED THAT

526
00:26:04,790 --> 00:26:05,490
AS AN EXAMPLE.

527
00:26:05,491 --> 00:26:07,192
ALL OF A SUDDEN HARLEY LEAVES.

528
00:26:07,192 --> 00:26:08,394
EVERYONE ELSE IS COMING IN.

529
00:26:08,394 --> 00:26:10,028
THEY ARE ONE OF THE FEW.

530
00:26:10,029 --> 00:26:11,529
EVERYONE ELSE IS COMING IN.

531
00:26:12,632 --> 00:26:13,399
HARLEY -- I THINK THEY ARE GOING

532
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:14,400
TO TAKE A BIG HIT.

533
00:26:14,401 --> 00:26:15,933
I THINK IT IS A GREAT AMERICAN

534
00:26:15,934 --> 00:26:16,902
PRODUCT, AND OUR PEOPLE HAVE

535
00:26:16,903 --> 00:26:17,970
MORE PRIDE THAN THEY USED TO

536
00:26:17,971 --> 00:26:18,269
HAVE.

537
00:26:18,270 --> 00:26:20,172
I REALLY BELIEVE THAT HARLEY'S

538
00:26:20,173 --> 00:26:21,673
GOING TO TAKE -- THE PEOPLE THAT

539
00:26:21,674 --> 00:26:24,209
ARE BUYING HARLEY-DAVIDSON, THEY

540
00:26:24,210 --> 00:26:26,345
DON'T WANT IT BUILT IN ANOTHER

541
00:26:26,346 --> 00:26:26,878
COUNTRY.

542
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:28,647
MARIA: THAT'S TRUE.

543
00:26:28,647 --> 00:26:29,881
>> I KNOW THOSE PEOPLE.

544
00:26:29,883 --> 00:26:31,250
THEY ARE MY VOTERS.

545
00:26:31,250 --> 00:26:31,950
MARIA: THEY HAVE PRIDE THAT

546
00:26:35,320 --> 00:26:36,988
>> THOSE ARE MY VOTERS THEY

547
00:26:36,990 --> 00:26:38,022
DON'T WANT HARLEY-DAVIDSON

548
00:26:38,023 --> 00:26:39,791
GETTING CUTE TO MAKE $2 MORE.

549
00:26:46,499 --> 00:26:46,899
IMMIGRATION.

550
00:26:46,900 --> 00:26:47,700
IS IMMIGRATION AND SEPARATION OF

551
00:26:47,701 --> 00:26:48,866
FAMILIES GOING TO HURT THE

552
00:26:49,935 --> 00:26:51,703
I SIGNED AN EXECUTIVE ORDER THAT

553
00:26:51,704 --> 00:26:53,471
I DON'T WANT FAMILIES BREAK UP.

554
00:26:53,472 --> 00:26:54,972
>> OUR FIRST LADY --

555
00:26:54,973 --> 00:26:56,207
>> SHE'S BEEN THERE AND OUT TO

556
00:26:56,209 --> 00:26:57,476
THE BORDER TWICE.

557
00:26:59,846 --> 00:27:01,846
>> SHE CAME HOME AND TOLD ME IT

558
00:27:01,847 --> 00:27:03,682
IS A VERY SAD SITUATION, VERY

559
00:27:03,682 --> 00:27:04,048
VERY SAD.

560
00:27:04,049 --> 00:27:05,349
SHE WAS REALLY IMPRESSED WITH

561
00:27:11,490 --> 00:27:13,692
THE PLIGHT OF PEOPLE, I MEAN,

562
00:27:13,692 --> 00:27:15,326
YOU KNOW, SHE HAS A VERY BIG

563
00:27:17,329 --> 00:27:18,297
WEEK AND A HALF.

564
00:27:18,298 --> 00:27:19,698
SHE FEELS IT.

565
00:27:19,699 --> 00:27:22,134
BUT SHE WAS SO STRONG ON HOW

566
00:27:22,134 --> 00:27:23,701
PROFESSIONAL THE BORDER PATROL,

567
00:27:28,974 --> 00:27:30,074
SHE SAW THE DANGER.

568
00:27:30,076 --> 00:27:33,178
IT JUST LOOKS LIKE DANGER.

569
00:27:33,179 --> 00:27:34,646
IN THE MEANTIME, WE HAVE TO HAVE

570
00:27:34,646 --> 00:27:35,847
STRONG BORDER PROTECTION.

571
00:27:35,848 --> 00:27:37,782
WE HAVE TO HAVE STRONG BORDERS.

572
00:27:39,885 --> 00:27:40,219
BORDERS.

573
00:27:40,220 --> 00:27:41,819
THEY WANT TO GET RID OF I.C.E.

574
00:27:41,820 --> 00:27:43,254
MARIA: I WAS GOING TO SAY THAT.

575
00:27:49,128 --> 00:27:51,696
AND GET THIS MORE DEMOCRATS ARE

576
00:27:51,698 --> 00:27:54,233
GETTING IN LINE WITH THAT.

577
00:27:54,233 --> 00:27:56,134
GILLIBRAND SAYING WE NEED TO

578
00:27:56,135 --> 00:27:56,868
ABOLISH I.C.E.

579
00:27:56,869 --> 00:27:58,369
>> I HOPE THEY KEEP THINKING OF

580
00:27:58,371 --> 00:27:58,670
THAT.

581
00:27:58,671 --> 00:27:59,837
THEY ARE GOING TO GET BEATEN SO

582
00:27:59,838 --> 00:28:00,138
BADLY.

583
00:28:00,140 --> 00:28:01,273
THESE ARE THE GUYS THAT GO IN

584
00:28:01,273 --> 00:28:03,641
AND TAKE MS 13 AND THEY TAKE

585
00:28:03,643 --> 00:28:04,742
THEM OUT BECAUSE THEY ARE MUCH

586
00:28:19,358 --> 00:28:20,091
OF YOUR HOUSE.

587
00:28:20,093 --> 00:28:21,293
YOU ARE GOING TO HAVE A COUNTRY

588
00:28:21,294 --> 00:28:22,761
THAT'S CRIME RIDDEN, THE BORDER

589
00:28:22,761 --> 00:28:23,662
PATROL, THE BORDER PATROL

590
00:28:23,663 --> 00:28:25,063
AGENTS, I.C.E., THESE PEOPLE ARE

591
00:28:25,064 --> 00:28:27,166
INCREDIBLE, THEY WERE THE ONES

592
00:28:27,166 --> 00:28:28,466
ACTUALLY WHEN MELANIA WENT DOWN,

593
00:28:28,468 --> 00:28:29,735
SHE WAS TALKING ABOUT THE BORDER

594
00:28:35,040 --> 00:28:36,340
ARE INCREDIBLE PATRIOTS.

595
00:28:38,912 --> 00:28:41,113
YOU KNOW LONG ISLAND VERY WELL.

596
00:28:41,114 --> 00:28:43,781
MARIA: CATCH AND RELEASE.

597
00:28:50,490 --> 00:28:53,692
IF THEY DO THAT, LIKE I ALWAYS

598
00:29:03,336 --> 00:29:05,170
YOU HAVE OPEN BORDERS, ALL IT'S

599
00:29:05,171 --> 00:29:07,072
GOING TO DO IS LEAD TO MASSIVE,

600
00:29:07,073 --> 00:29:07,840
MASSIVE CRIME.

601
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:09,774
THAT'S GOING TO BE THEIR

602
00:29:09,776 --> 00:29:10,475
PLATFORM.

603
00:29:10,476 --> 00:29:13,146
OPEN BORDERS WHICH EQUALS CRIME.

604
00:49:19,458 --> 00:49:21,224
PRESIDENT CAN BRING THE COUNTRY

605
00:49:21,226 --> 00:49:22,326
TOGETHER AS THE POLITICAL

606
00:49:22,327 --> 00:49:25,630
RHETORIC GROWS MORE EXTREME.

607
00:49:25,630 --> 00:49:27,364
TAKE A LOOK.

608
00:49:27,365 --> 00:49:28,565
REAL QUICK ON NORTH KOREA AND

609
00:49:28,567 --> 00:49:30,934
IRAN, HOW WAS THE SUMMIT?

610
00:49:30,936 --> 00:49:33,004
CAN YOU GIVE US ANECDOTES?

611
00:49:33,005 --> 00:49:34,305
WE ARE SUPPOSED TO FIND OUT -- I

612
00:49:34,306 --> 00:49:37,708
HAVE SPOKEN WITH SOME MILITARY

613
00:49:37,708 --> 00:49:39,210
OF MY OWN AND THEY TOLD ME THAT

614
00:49:39,210 --> 00:49:40,477
NORTH KOREA NEEDS TO TELL US

615
00:49:40,478 --> 00:49:41,645
EXACTLY WHERE THEIR FACILITIES

616
00:49:41,646 --> 00:49:42,579
ARE SO WE CAN INSPECT THEM

617
00:49:42,581 --> 00:49:43,748
WITHIN THE NEXT FEW WEEKS.

618
00:49:43,748 --> 00:49:44,881
IF WE DON'T FIND OUT IN THE NEXT

619
00:49:44,882 --> 00:49:46,250
FEW WEEKS, WE KNOW THEY ARE NOT

620
00:49:46,251 --> 00:49:47,218
SERIOUS ABOUT THIS.

621
00:49:47,219 --> 00:49:48,418
WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO?

622
00:49:48,420 --> 00:49:49,286
>> I THINK THEY ARE VERY SERIOUS

623
00:49:49,286 --> 00:49:50,253
ABOUT IT.

624
00:49:50,255 --> 00:49:52,590
WE HAD A VERY GOOD CHEMISTRY.

625
00:49:52,590 --> 00:49:55,592
YOU KNOW, WE HAD A LOT OF

626
00:49:55,594 --> 00:49:55,925
POINTS.

627
00:49:55,927 --> 00:49:58,295
WE WENT ON A LOT OF DIFFERENT

628
00:49:58,295 --> 00:50:03,500
POINTS, NOT TO GO OVER THEM,

629
00:50:03,501 --> 00:50:05,436
DENUCLEARIZATION GETTING THE

630
00:50:05,436 --> 00:50:07,570
REMAINS BACK FROM GREAT HEROES,

631
00:50:07,572 --> 00:50:09,306
GREAT PEOPLE, GETTING THE

632
00:50:09,306 --> 00:50:09,773
HOSTAGES BACK.

633
00:50:09,775 --> 00:50:11,008
MARIA: THAT WAS INCREDIBLE.

634
00:50:11,009 --> 00:50:12,208
THANK YOU FOR DOING THAT, MR.

635
00:50:12,210 --> 00:50:12,576
PRESIDENT.

636
00:50:12,577 --> 00:50:13,911
>> WHAT DID I DO, REALLY, WHEN

637
00:50:13,911 --> 00:50:14,744
YOU THINK OF IT?

638
00:50:14,746 --> 00:50:15,579
I WENT THERE.

639
00:50:18,449 --> 00:50:20,617
SO WE HAD A MEETING.

640
00:50:20,619 --> 00:50:24,689
WE DIDN'T DO ANYTHING.

641
00:50:24,690 --> 00:50:26,891
NOW, I ASKED, I SAID LET'S NOT

642
00:50:26,891 --> 00:50:28,558
DO -- I CALL THEM THE WAR GAMES,

643
00:50:28,559 --> 00:50:29,893
THEY ARE DROPPING BOMBS ALL OVER

644
00:50:29,894 --> 00:50:31,961
THE PLACE EVERY SIX MONTHS.

645
00:50:31,963 --> 00:50:33,531
IT IS UNBELIEVABLY EXPENSIVE TO

646
00:50:33,532 --> 00:50:34,465
DO THAT.

647
00:50:34,465 --> 00:50:36,166
PLANES FLY IN FROM GUAM, THESE

648
00:50:36,168 --> 00:50:39,370
MASSIVE, YOU KNOW, BOMBERS, AND

649
00:50:39,371 --> 00:50:42,306
THEY ARE FLYING IN FROM GUAM, IT

650
00:50:42,306 --> 00:50:44,007
IS CRAZY.

651
00:50:44,009 --> 00:50:44,742
SO WE GAVE NOTHING.

652
00:50:44,742 --> 00:50:46,210
WHAT WE ARE GOING TO GIVE IS

653
00:50:48,813 --> 00:50:50,914
NORTH KOREA HAS A TREMENDOUS

654
00:50:50,916 --> 00:50:51,248
FUTURE.

655
00:50:51,248 --> 00:50:53,451
I GOT A LONG REALLY -- I GOT

656
00:50:53,452 --> 00:50:54,618
ALONG REALLY WELL WITH CHAIRMAN

657
00:50:54,619 --> 00:50:54,885
KIM.

658
00:50:54,885 --> 00:50:57,654
WE HAD A GREAT CHEMISTRY.

659
00:50:57,655 --> 00:50:58,788
WE REALLY HAD -- CHAIRMAN --

660
00:50:58,789 --> 00:50:59,956
MARIA: DO WE BELIEVE HIM, MR.

661
00:50:59,958 --> 00:51:00,324
PRESIDENT?

662
00:51:00,324 --> 00:51:01,791
>> I'VE MADE A DEAL WITH HIM.

663
00:51:01,793 --> 00:51:03,227
I SHOOK HANDS WITH HIM.

664
00:51:03,228 --> 00:51:05,296
I REALLY BELIEVE HE MEANS IT.

665
00:51:05,297 --> 00:51:06,563
NOW, IS IT POSSIBLE -- HAVE I

666
00:51:06,565 --> 00:51:07,231
BEEN IN DEALS?

667
00:51:14,306 --> 00:51:14,739
ON IRAN.

668
00:51:14,739 --> 00:51:16,339
I MEAN, THIS WAS INCREDIBLE.

669
00:51:16,340 --> 00:51:18,775
>> IRAN LOOK WHAT'S HAPPENING IN

670
00:51:20,244 --> 00:51:23,246
PROTESTS PEOPLE WANT ECONOMIC

671
00:51:23,248 --> 00:51:23,681
FREEDOM.

672
00:51:23,681 --> 00:51:25,615
>> IRAN'S A DIFFERENT PLACE.

673
00:51:25,617 --> 00:51:26,684
THEY ARE NO LONGER THINKING

674
00:51:26,684 --> 00:51:28,384
ABOUT THE MEDITERRANEAN AND

675
00:51:28,385 --> 00:51:29,786
GOING THROUGH -- THEY ARE

676
00:51:29,788 --> 00:51:30,954
THINKING ABOUT THEMSELVES.

677
00:51:30,956 --> 00:51:31,956
THEY ARE HAVING RIOTS.

678
00:51:31,956 --> 00:51:34,574
>> ARE THEY ENRICHING ROOUR

679
00:51:35,193 --> 00:51:35,309
>> ARE THEY ENRICH INGROOU

680

>> ARE THEY ENRICHING URANI

692
00:51:37,362 --> 00:51:37,628
>> ARE THEY ENRICHING URANIUM

693
00:51:37,628 --> 00:51:40,730
LIKE THE REPORTS SAY?

694
00:51:40,731 --> 00:51:42,599
>> IF THEY DO, THEY ARE GOING TO

695
00:51:50,976 --> 00:51:52,910
>> 100%, OPEC IS AND THEY BETTER

696
00:51:52,911 --> 00:51:54,010
STOP IT.

697
00:51:54,012 --> 00:51:55,746
WE'RE PROTECTING MANY OF THOSE

698
00:51:55,746 --> 00:51:56,179
COUNTRIES.

699
00:51:56,181 --> 00:51:57,947
OPEC IS MANIPULATING.

700
00:51:59,717 --> 00:52:01,985
THEY HAVE TO PUT OUT ANOTHER 2

701
00:52:01,987 --> 00:52:02,853
MILLION BARRELS IN MY OPINION

702
00:52:02,853 --> 00:52:03,987
BECAUSE WE DON'T WANT THAT

703
00:52:03,989 --> 00:52:04,355
HAPPENING.

704
00:52:04,356 --> 00:52:05,422
DON'T FORGET THE ONE NEGATIVE TO

705
00:52:05,422 --> 00:52:07,056
THE IRAN DEAL IS YOU'RE GOING TO

706
00:52:07,057 --> 00:52:07,958
LOSE A LOT OF OIL.

707
00:52:07,958 --> 00:52:11,227
AND THEY'RE GOING TO MAKE UP FOR

708
00:52:11,228 --> 00:52:11,494
IT.

709
00:52:11,496 --> 00:52:13,798
WHO IS THEIR BIG ENEMY?

710
00:52:13,798 --> 00:52:14,331
IRAN.

711
00:52:14,331 --> 00:52:14,964
YOU THINK OF IT.

712
00:52:14,965 --> 00:52:16,333
THEY WILL HAVE TO DO IT.

713
00:52:16,333 --> 00:52:17,400
I HAVE A VERY GOOD RELATIONSHIP

714
00:52:17,402 --> 00:52:18,769
WITH THE KING AND WITH THE CROWN

715
00:52:18,769 --> 00:52:21,472
PRINCE OF SAUDI ARABIA AND THE

716
00:52:21,472 --> 00:52:22,273
OTHERS AROUND, AND THEY ARE

717
00:52:22,273 --> 00:52:23,973
GOING TO PUT OUT MORE OIL.

718
00:52:23,974 --> 00:52:25,842
>> ANY COMMENTS ON PETER STRZOK

719
00:52:25,844 --> 00:52:27,845
AND THESE TESTIMONIES THAT WE'RE

720
00:52:27,846 --> 00:52:30,947
SEEING, ROSENSTEIN, CHRISTOPHER

721
00:52:30,949 --> 00:52:32,282
WRAY, WHY DON'T YOU JUST DIRECT

722
00:52:32,284 --> 00:52:33,784
YOUR SUBORDINATES TO GET THOSE

723
00:52:33,784 --> 00:52:34,518
DOCUMENTS OVER TO CONGRESS?

724
00:52:34,518 --> 00:52:36,820
ARE YOU GOING TO DO IT?

725
00:52:36,822 --> 00:52:39,222
>> SO I HAVE THIS COUNTRY

726
00:52:39,224 --> 00:52:40,524
RUNNING AT THE TOP, MIKE POMPEO

727
00:52:40,525 --> 00:52:41,025
IS DOING GREAT.

728
00:52:41,025 --> 00:52:42,592
WE HAVE A GREAT GROUP OF PEOPLE.

729
00:52:42,594 --> 00:52:44,829
THE ONE THING I WANT TO STAY

730
00:52:44,829 --> 00:52:46,197
UNINVOLVED IN AT LEAST FOR NOW I

731
00:52:46,197 --> 00:52:47,864
MAY GET INVOLVED BUT I HAVE BEEN

732
00:52:47,865 --> 00:52:52,969
TOLD BY SO MANY PEOPLE DON'T GET

733
00:52:52,971 --> 00:52:53,704
INVOLVED.

734
00:52:53,704 --> 00:52:54,204
IT'S NOT GOOD.

735
00:52:54,206 --> 00:52:56,373
THEY WILL GET THE DOCUMENTS.

736
00:52:56,373 --> 00:52:58,041
THEY ARE GREAT PEOPLE.

737
00:52:58,043 --> 00:52:59,242
I DIDN'T LIKE THE SCENE THE

738
00:52:59,244 --> 00:53:00,644
OTHER DAY WHERE EVERYBODY IS

739
00:53:00,644 --> 00:53:01,478
SCREAMING AT EACH OTHER.

740
00:53:01,478 --> 00:53:02,245
I DON'T LIKE THAT.

741
00:53:02,246 --> 00:53:03,746
IT IS BAD FOR THE COUNTRY.

742
00:53:03,748 --> 00:53:06,383
IF RUSSIA IS IN FACT LOOKING TO

743
00:53:06,384 --> 00:53:07,784
SOW DISCORD OR CHAOS, THEY HAVE

744
00:53:07,786 --> 00:53:09,787
GOT TO BE SAYING THIS IS THE

745
00:53:09,788 --> 00:53:10,487
GREATEST THING WE HAVE EVER

746
00:53:10,487 --> 00:53:11,288
DONE.

747
00:53:11,289 --> 00:53:11,789
OKAY?

748
00:53:11,789 --> 00:53:12,956
NOW, THERE'S NO COLLUSION WITH

749
00:53:12,958 --> 00:53:13,257
ME.

750
00:53:13,257 --> 00:53:14,557
THERE'S NO RUSSIA WITH ME.

751
00:53:14,559 --> 00:53:15,926
THERE'S NO NOTHING.

752
00:53:19,496 --> 00:53:21,664
BUT I PURPOSELY SAID I'M NOT

753
00:53:21,666 --> 00:53:22,700
GETTING INVOLVED.

754
00:53:22,701 --> 00:53:23,567
LET IT JUST GO.

755
00:53:23,568 --> 00:53:25,202
YOU KNOW, THEY FOUND NOTHING.

756
00:53:25,202 --> 00:53:26,003
NOBODY HAS FOUND ANYTHING.

757
00:53:26,003 --> 00:53:26,769
MARIA: I KNOW.

758
00:53:26,771 --> 00:53:27,304
ARE YOU GOING --

759
00:53:27,304 --> 00:53:30,773
>> BY THE WAY, THIS IS THE MOST

760
00:53:30,775 --> 00:53:32,041
TRANSPARENT THING EVER DONE WITH

761
00:53:32,043 --> 00:53:32,543
THE WHITE HOUSE.

762
00:53:32,543 --> 00:53:36,480
I THINK I GAVE THEM A MILLION

763
00:53:36,481 --> 00:53:38,215
400,000 DOCUMENTS I TOLD THEM

764
00:53:38,215 --> 00:53:38,949
DON'T EVEN READ THEM.

765
00:53:38,949 --> 00:53:40,183
THERE'S NO RUSSIA MENTIONED OR

766
00:53:40,184 --> 00:53:40,750
ANYTHING LIKE THAT.

767
00:53:40,751 --> 00:53:41,284
THEY HAVE NOTHING.

768
00:53:43,454 --> 00:53:43,953
IT IS TERRIBLE.

769
00:53:43,954 --> 00:53:44,954
IT IS BAD FOR BOTH SIDES.

770
00:53:44,956 --> 00:53:45,890
MARIA: ARE YOU GOING TO MENTION

771
00:53:45,891 --> 00:53:50,728
THE MEDDLING WHEN YOU MEET WITH

772
00:53:50,728 --> 00:53:51,327
THE RUSSIAN PRESIDENT?

773
00:53:51,329 --> 00:53:53,197
>> I WOULD LIKE TO SEE SOME

774
00:53:55,266 --> 00:53:57,768
TAKE THE SERVER FROM THE DNC.

775
00:53:57,768 --> 00:53:59,569
>> THE DNC WANTED TO GIVE IT TO

776
00:53:59,570 --> 00:54:03,172
A PRIVATE COMPANY.

777
00:54:03,173 --> 00:54:04,240
THEY DIDN'T WANT TO GIVE IT TO

778
00:54:04,242 --> 00:54:04,575
THE FBI.

779
00:54:04,576 --> 00:54:06,876
>> WHY DIDN'T THE FBI TAKE IT?

780
00:54:06,878 --> 00:54:08,045
LOOK WHAT THEY DID TO OTHER

781
00:54:08,045 --> 00:54:08,378
PEOPLE.

782
00:54:08,380 --> 00:54:09,780
WHY DIDN'T THEY TAKE IT?

783
00:54:09,780 --> 00:54:12,181
HOW CAN THE DNC SAY GET OUT OF

784
00:54:12,182 --> 00:54:12,483
HERE.

785
00:54:12,483 --> 00:54:13,616
THEY THREW THEM OUT OF THE

786
00:54:13,617 --> 00:54:13,951
OFFICE.

787
00:54:13,952 --> 00:54:15,586
>> THE SAME PEOPLE RUNNING BOTH

788
00:54:15,586 --> 00:54:16,052
INVESTIGATIONS.

789
00:54:16,054 --> 00:54:16,452
THAT'S WHY.

790
00:54:16,454 --> 00:54:17,488
>> DID YOU EVER SEE A DIFFERENCE

791
00:54:17,489 --> 00:54:18,789
IN TWO INVESTIGATIONS?

792
00:54:18,789 --> 00:54:21,425
>> HUGE DIFFERENCE, MR.

793
00:54:21,425 --> 00:54:21,991
PRESIDENT.

794
00:54:21,992 --> 00:54:23,726
>> THE DIFFERENCE HERE THIS ONE

795
00:54:23,728 --> 00:54:24,494
DID NOTHING WRONG, NO COLLUSION,

796
00:54:24,496 --> 00:54:24,894
NO NOTHING.

797
00:54:24,896 --> 00:54:26,730
THE OTHER ONE -- I'M NOT SAYING

798
00:54:26,731 --> 00:54:28,198
ONE WAY OR THE OTHER, BUT YOU GO

799
00:54:28,199 --> 00:54:29,666
BACK, HOW ABOUT THE E-MAILS

800
00:54:29,668 --> 00:54:31,702
DELETING 33,000 E-MAILS?

801
00:54:31,702 --> 00:54:33,304
WE DON'T EVEN HAVE TO TALK ABOUT

802
00:54:33,304 --> 00:54:34,605
THE URANIUM AND ALL THE

803
00:54:34,606 --> 00:54:36,707
DIFFERENT -- JUST TELL ME, YOU

804
00:54:36,708 --> 00:54:37,307
GET A SUBPOENA.

805
00:54:37,309 --> 00:54:39,710
AND AFTER GETTING THE SUBPOENA

806
00:54:39,710 --> 00:54:40,576
FROM THE UNITED STATES CONGRESS,

807
00:54:40,577 --> 00:54:40,878
RIGHT?

808
00:54:40,878 --> 00:54:42,645
PEOPLE GO TO JAIL FOR DOING IT

809
00:54:42,646 --> 00:54:44,914
ON A CIVIL CASE.

810
00:54:44,916 --> 00:54:47,051
THEY DELETE 33,000 E-MAILS.

811
00:54:47,052 --> 00:54:49,887
MARIA: SOME OF THEM GOT

812
00:54:49,887 --> 00:54:50,253
IMMUNITY.

813
00:54:50,255 --> 00:54:51,188
>> BEFORE THE FBI EVEN WALKED

814
00:54:51,188 --> 00:54:52,789
IN, THEY ARE WALKING IN AND SAY

815
00:54:52,791 --> 00:54:53,990
YOU HAVE -- BY THE WAY, KEEP

816
00:54:53,992 --> 00:54:57,327
YOUR LAPTOPS AND THEN THEY EVEN

817
00:54:57,329 --> 00:54:59,763
SAY DESTROY YOUR LAPTOPS OR

818
00:55:02,934 --> 00:55:04,802
DESTROY YOUR LAPTOPS?

819
00:55:08,840 --> 00:55:11,608
WE SEE PETER FONDA ROBERT DE

820
00:55:15,612 --> 00:55:17,313
VITRIOL IN THIS COUNTRY, AS THE

821
00:55:17,315 --> 00:55:18,014
COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF, AS THE

822
00:55:18,016 --> 00:55:20,416
PRESIDENT OF THIS GREAT COUNTRY,

823
00:55:20,418 --> 00:55:22,419
WHAT CAN YOU DO TO BRING US

824
00:55:22,420 --> 00:55:22,786
TOGETHER?

825
00:55:22,786 --> 00:55:26,489
>> SOME OF THEM DO IT FOR

826
00:55:26,490 --> 00:55:26,856
PUBLICITY.

827
00:55:26,858 --> 00:55:27,958
I HATE TO SAY IT.

828
00:55:27,958 --> 00:55:30,493
SOME OF THEM DO IT FOR

829
00:55:30,494 --> 00:55:30,860
PUBLICITY.

830
00:55:30,862 --> 00:55:31,628
THE RESTAURANT I THOUGHT IT WAS

831
00:55:31,628 --> 00:55:32,295
TERRIBLE WITH SARAH.

832
00:55:32,297 --> 00:55:32,996
>> IT IS ALL TERRIBLE.

833
00:55:32,998 --> 00:55:34,630
>> I THINK SOME OF THE THINGS

834
00:55:34,632 --> 00:55:35,699
THAT ARE SAID ARE TERRIBLE.

835
00:55:35,699 --> 00:55:38,768
AND YOU KNOW, IT'S OUR PEOPLE

836
00:55:38,769 --> 00:55:41,804
ARE SO INCREDIBLE -- DO YOU

837
00:55:41,806 --> 00:55:42,606
KNOW, THERE'S PROBABLY NEVER

838
00:55:42,606 --> 00:55:44,775
BEEN A BASE IN THE HISTORY OF

839
00:55:44,775 --> 00:55:46,409
POLITICS IN THIS COUNTRY LIKE MY

840
00:55:46,411 --> 00:55:46,710
BASE.

841
00:55:46,710 --> 00:55:48,778
I HOPE THE OTHER SIDE REALIZES

842
00:55:50,447 --> 00:55:52,248
THEY BETTER JUST TAKE IT EASY

843
00:55:52,250 --> 00:55:54,684
BECAUSE SOME OF THE LANGUAGE

844
00:55:54,686 --> 00:55:56,253
USED, SOME OF THE WORDS USED,

845
00:56:01,425 --> 00:56:02,893
I THINK THEY ARE ACTUALLY VERY

846
00:56:02,893 --> 00:56:03,860
DANGEROUS FOR THE COUNTRY.

847
00:56:03,862 --> 00:56:05,229
>> ALL THE WHILE YOU ARE

848
00:56:05,230 --> 00:56:06,329
CREATING ECONOMIC GROWTH AND JOB

849
00:56:06,331 --> 00:56:06,764
OPPORTUNITIES.

850
00:56:06,764 --> 00:56:08,297
>> SO IF YOU LOOK AT BLACK

851
00:56:08,298 --> 00:56:09,500
UNEMPLOYMENT, THE BEST IN

852
00:56:09,501 --> 00:56:10,234
HISTORY.

853
00:56:10,235 --> 00:56:11,568
HISPANIC UNEMPLOYMENT, THE BEST

854
00:56:11,568 --> 00:56:12,268
IN HISTORY.

855
00:56:12,269 --> 00:56:15,605
LOWEST IN THE HISTORY OF OUR

856
00:56:18,777 --> 00:56:20,510
65 YEARS, WITHIN TWO WEEKS IT

857
00:56:20,512 --> 00:56:22,211
SHOULD BE THE BEST IN HISTORY,

858
00:56:25,784 --> 00:56:26,416
SO LOW.

859
00:56:26,418 --> 00:56:27,584
SO BEAUTIFUL.

860
00:56:27,585 --> 00:56:29,318
OUR UNEMPLOYMENT PICTURE OVERALL

861
00:56:29,320 --> 00:56:31,055
GENERALLY IS ALMOST THE BEST IN

862
00:56:31,056 --> 00:56:31,387
HISTORY.

863
00:56:31,389 --> 00:56:32,890
OUR NUMBERS ARE AMONG -- IT IS

864
00:56:32,891 --> 00:56:34,023
GOING TO BE INTERESTING TO SEE

865
00:56:34,025 --> 00:56:34,858
WHAT HAPPENS IN THE NEXT

866
00:56:34,858 --> 00:56:35,525
QUARTER.

867
00:56:35,527 --> 00:56:36,726
BUT, YOU KNOW, I DON'T KNOW IF

868
00:56:36,728 --> 00:56:38,729
YOU SAW IT, BUT THE ATLANTA FED

869
00:56:38,730 --> 00:56:39,829
PREDICTED 4.8.

870
00:56:39,831 --> 00:56:40,329
I DON'T KNOW --

871
00:56:40,331 --> 00:56:41,298
MARIA: OF COURSE I SAW.

872
00:56:41,298 --> 00:56:43,699
>> I SAW IT ON YOUR SHOW.

873
00:56:43,701 --> 00:56:44,434
MARIA: THANK YOU.

874
00:56:44,436 --> 00:56:45,836
>> MAYBE YOU WEREN'T WATCHING.

875
00:56:45,836 --> 00:56:46,903
MARIA: I WAS ON THE SHOW.

876
00:56:46,905 --> 00:56:47,271
[LAUGHTER]

877
00:56:47,271 --> 00:56:49,505
>> BUT THE ATLANTA FED PREDICTED

878
00:56:49,507 --> 00:56:49,773
4.6.

879
00:56:49,773 --> 00:56:51,607
THEN THEY UPPED IT TO 4.8.

880
00:56:51,608 --> 00:56:52,543
I DON'T KNOW IF THAT'S TRUE.

881
00:56:52,543 --> 00:56:54,310
BUT EACH POINT IS 3 TRILLION

882
00:56:54,311 --> 00:56:55,211
DOLLARS AND 10 MILLION JOBS.

883
00:56:55,213 --> 00:56:57,047
AND YOU KNOW THAT WHEN I

884
00:56:57,047 --> 00:57:00,016
ORIGINALLY TOOK OVER, IT WAS

885
00:57:02,686 --> 00:57:04,420
THEY WANTED TO PUT MORE -- WE

886
00:57:04,422 --> 00:57:06,889
TALKED ABOUT THE REGULATIONS AND

887
00:57:06,891 --> 00:57:07,324
RESTRICTIONS.

888
00:57:07,324 --> 00:57:08,692
THEY WANTED TO PUT MORE

889
00:57:08,693 --> 00:57:09,193
REGULATIONS ON.

890
00:57:09,193 --> 00:57:10,393
THEY WOULDN'T HAVE DONE ANY TAX

891
00:57:10,394 --> 00:57:10,693
CUTS.

892
00:57:10,695 --> 00:57:12,596
FOR THE TAX CUTS WE DIDN'T GET

893
00:57:12,597 --> 00:57:13,664
ONE DEMOCRAT VOTE.

894
00:57:13,664 --> 00:57:15,231
NOW, ADD THIS TO IT, PART OF

895
00:57:15,233 --> 00:57:16,266
THEIR PLATFORM, ONE OTHER THING

896
00:57:16,266 --> 00:57:17,835
THEY WANT TO DO, THEY WANT TO

897
00:57:17,835 --> 00:57:18,534
RAISE THE TAXES.

898
00:57:21,206 --> 00:57:22,905
WANT TO RAISE THE TAXES.

899
00:57:22,907 --> 00:57:24,208
I DON'T THINK THAT'S A VERY GOOD

900
00:57:24,208 --> 00:57:27,510
FORMULA FOR THE COUNTRY, NUMBER

901
00:57:27,512 --> 00:57:28,879
ONE, MOST IMPORTANTLY BUT ALSO

902
00:57:28,880 --> 00:57:31,014
NOT A GOOD FORMULA TO GET

903
00:57:31,014 --> 00:57:31,347
ELECTED.

904
00:57:31,349 --> 00:57:32,216
MARIA: YOU THINK THIS WILL BE

905
00:57:32,217 --> 00:57:33,349
THE KEY THAT WILL DRIVE VOTERS

906
00:57:33,351 --> 00:57:34,017
IN THE NOVEMBER ELECTION?

907
00:57:34,018 --> 00:57:35,219
>> I THINK THE TAX CUTS WILL BE

908
00:57:35,219 --> 00:57:35,585
IMPORTANT.

909
00:57:35,586 --> 00:57:36,887
I THINK THE REGULATIONS WILL BE

910
00:57:36,887 --> 00:57:37,253
IMPORTANT.

911
00:57:38,889 --> 00:57:40,456
>> HONESTLY I FEEL ACTUALLY

912
00:57:40,458 --> 00:57:40,757
GOOD.

913
00:57:40,757 --> 00:57:41,991
THE ONLY THING I FEEL BAD ABOUT

914
00:57:41,992 --> 00:57:44,228
IS THAT I GUESS 93% OF THE TIME

915
00:57:44,228 --> 00:57:45,695
WHOEVER WINS THE PRESIDENCY

916
00:57:45,697 --> 00:57:47,731
TENDS TO DO NOT SO GOOD IN THE

917
00:57:50,869 --> 00:57:52,635
MAY BE -- LOOK YOU DO THIS FOR A

918
00:57:52,637 --> 00:57:54,338
LIVING AND NOBODY DOES IT

919
00:57:54,338 --> 00:57:55,806
BETTER, THIS MAY BE THE GREATEST

920
00:57:55,806 --> 00:57:56,472
ECONOMY WE HAVE EVER HAD.

921
00:57:56,474 --> 00:57:57,908
SO IF IT'S ALL ABOUT THE

922
00:57:57,909 --> 00:57:59,977
ECONOMY, I THINK WE SHOULD DO

923
00:57:59,978 --> 00:58:01,644
PHENOMENALLY.

924
00:58:01,646 --> 00:58:04,414
I THINK WE'RE GOING TO DO GREAT

925
00:58:04,414 --> 00:58:04,914
IN THE SENATE.

926
00:58:04,916 --> 00:58:06,048
I VISITED THREE STATES IN THE

927
00:58:06,050 --> 00:58:06,984
LAST SIX DAYS.

928
00:58:06,985 --> 00:58:08,050
I THINK EVERY ONE OF THOSE

929
00:58:08,052 --> 00:58:09,452
PEOPLE HAVE AN AWFULLY GOOD

930
00:58:12,056 --> 00:58:12,588
IN THE SENATE.

931
00:58:12,590 --> 00:58:14,490
I THINK WE'RE GOING TO GO

932
00:58:17,027 --> 00:58:18,261
BACK TO THE CAMPAIGN RALLY.

933
00:58:18,262 --> 00:58:19,962
>> I DO LIKE IT.

934
00:58:23,601 --> 00:58:23,934
COUNTRY.

935
00:58:23,934 --> 00:58:24,800
THEY ARE GREAT.

936
00:58:24,802 --> 00:58:26,202
MARIA: I SEE IT.

937
00:58:28,438 --> 00:58:29,739
>> THANK YOU MARIA.

938
00:58:29,740 --> 00:58:30,407
>> THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR

939
00:58:30,407 --> 00:58:30,806
JOINING US.

940
00:58:30,807 --> 00:58:31,340
>> THANK YOU.

941
00:58:33,911 --> 00:58:35,878
TRUMP FOR JOINING US.

942
00:58:35,880 --> 00:58:36,914
YOU HEARD THE PRESIDENT MENTION

943
00:58:36,914 --> 00:58:39,215
OIL PRICES YESTERDAY HE TWEETED

944
00:58:46,690 --> 00:58:49,525
IRAN AND VENEZUELA I'M ASKING

945
00:58:49,527 --> 00:58:50,693
THAT SAUDI ARABIA INCREASE OIL

946
00:58:53,364 --> 00:58:53,764
DIFFERENCE.

947
00:58:53,764 --> 00:58:54,830
PRICES TO HIGH.

948
00:58:54,831 --> 00:58:55,565
HE HAS AGREED.

949
00:58:55,567 --> 00:58:56,532
-- PRICES TOO HIGH.

950
00:58:56,534 --> 00:58:57,233
HE HAS AGREED.

951
00:58:57,235 --> 00:58:58,402
THE WHITE HOUSE ISSUED A

952
00:58:58,402 --> 00:59:00,203
STATEMENT SAYING THE SAUDI KING

953
00:59:00,204 --> 00:59:04,208
AGREED TO RAISE OUTPUT IF NEEDED
